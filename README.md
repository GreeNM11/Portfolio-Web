# My Portfolio Website

Link: https://greenm11.github.io/Portfolio-Web/

Showcases all my work experience and projects

---

## Project Resources
1. Uses html + css in VSCode
2. Has some java script functions for website features like auto playing videos, drop downs, and a carousel of images

## Notes:
1. I thought the perfect way to learn website building/design while also making something useful was the popular choice of my own portfolio and I'm happy how it turned out
2. I will keep adding onto it and expand as I build a larger work profile
